# Spotify Wrapped ver.2

## Overview

This is the repository for my project which examines the relationship between a song's audio features and its assigned genres. It also attempts to reclassify songs using unsupervised learning and performs visualization of my listening patterns at the week and day levels. The results of my project can be found on this [Streamlit website](https://mattzhao-r-spotify-intro-f69ftq.streamlitapp.com/) I created (the code for the website is also in this repo).

### Organization

Since the project itself is discussed in the website, I will briefly go over the organization of the repo. In the `data` folder is the data from my Spotify user request and `drafts` contains the draft Jupyter Notebooks through which I sketched out the various methods and analyses I performed. `final` contains two 'final' datasets I created for analysis and visualization while `graphs` contains graphs used in my website. `pages` holds the additional pages of my website and the corresponding primary page is `Intro.py`. Lastly, my notebooks titled `DGP`, `Final Analysis`, and `Final Visualization` are the completed methods and analyses for this project and draw from the python scripts `methods.py`, `objects.py`, and `parallelization.py`. `requirements.txt` is the dependencies file for my Streamlit website and `viz_methods.py` contain the methods for the visuals seen in page 5 of the website.
