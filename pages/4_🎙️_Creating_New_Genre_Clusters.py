## Creating New Genre Clusters

In this section I attempted to create new song groupings to see if there were better ways to group together songs than just their genres. To do this, I used unsupervised learning, specific k-means clustering, to identify new 'genres' in my songs. To find the optimal number of clusters k, I used the elbow method and found 15 to be the best as seen below.

Once I had added the new cluster assignments to each song, I wanted to see how these compared to the actual genres my songs had been assigned. To do this, I looked at the 5 most common genres for each cluster to see the type of music each cluster roughly corresponded to. You can see an example for some of the clusters below:

Since some clusters had the same top genre, I used the next most common genre for that cluster. There are significant limitations to my current method in regrouping these songs so I hope to revisit this project at a later time to perform more analyses. Specifically, I want to use a large sample of songs and attempt to get more accurate genres for my data and I want to examine the trends within each of my playlists to see if they are cohesive or could use some reorganizing.
